# FraSCAtiVariabilityEvolution

Details and material, including feature models and FAMILIAR script, about the ECSA/CAiSE/SoSyM papers "Reverse engineering architectural feature models" https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00614984, "Feature model differences" https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00713849v2/document, and "Extraction and evolution of architectural variability models in plugin-based systems" https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00859472

The original content was hosted on https://nyx.unice.fr/projects/familiar/ but the server is out. 
We are moving the content here:
 * [Reverse engineering architectural feature models](ArchFm.md)
 * [Feature model differences](DiffFMs.md)
 * [Extraction and evolution of architectural variability models in plugin-based systems](FraSCAti.md)
 * see others with VariCell, KSynthesis, etc. (unformated) 

The content here is mostly pedagogical explanations, tutorials, and some visualizations. 
There are also FeatureIDE models. 
Normally, the scripts are executable in the [FAMILIAR repository](https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/familiar-language/), either with a .fml file or with a Java test case. 
For example: https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/familiar-language/blob/master/familiar.test/src/test/java/fr/familiar/featureide/AdamArchTest.java
for the FraSCAti evolution/reverse engineering.
